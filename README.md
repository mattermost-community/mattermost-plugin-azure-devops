## Features

- Right-hand sidebar (RHS) shows the list of linked projects and subscriptions created for each project with separate buttons to connect an account, link or unlink a project and add or delete a subscription.

- Preview of the work item, pull request, release or build URL: A preview of the work item, pull request, release or build for a linked project will be created when their respective URLs are posted in a channel and the user is connected to his/her Azure DevOps account.

- OAuth: A user can connect or disconnect to their Azure DevOps account using the slash command below or clicking on the "Connect Your Account" button in RHS.

    /azuredevops connect
    /azuredevops disconnect

- Link projects: A user can link a project existing on Azure DevOps using the slash command below or clicking on the "Link new project" button in RHS.

    ```
    /azuredevops link [project link]
    ```

- Unlink projects: A user can unlink a project appearing in the RHS under "Linked Projects" by clicking on the unlink-icon button.

- Create work items: A work item can be created using the slash command below.

- Add subscriptions: A user can create subscriptions for a linked project to get notifications in a selected channel for selected events on work items, pull requests and pipelines.
To add a new subscription for a linked project click on the project title under "Linked Projects" in RHS then click on the "Add new subscription" button in the subscription view. Users can also create subscriptions using the slash command below.
    - For creating Boards subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops boards subscription add
    ```

    - For creating Repos subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops repos subscription add
    ```

    - For creating Pipelines subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops pipelines subscription add
    ```

    **Note:** Only Mattermost users who are project admins or team admins on the linked Azure DevOps project can create/delete a subscription.

- View/List subscriptions: A user can view the list of subscriptions for a project by going to the subscriptions list page after clicking on the project title under "Linked Projects" in the right-hand sidebar. Users can also view the list of all subscriptions for a channel by using the below slash command in the channel.

    - For listing Boards subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops boards subscription list anyone all_channels
    ```

    - For listing Repos subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops repos subscription list anyone all_channels 
    ```

    - For listing Pipelines subscriptions

    ```
    /azuredevops pipelines subscription list anyone all_channels 
    ```

    Supported filters on the above slash command:
    - CreatedBy: `me`(show all subscriptions created by the current Mattermost user), `anyone`(show all subscriptions created by any Mattermost user)
    - Show for all channels: When the filter `all_channels` is passed in the slash command then subscriptions for all channels are listed. You can skip this filter param to list the subscriptions of the current channel only.

    **Note:** Only Mattermost users who are project admins or team admins on the linked Azure DevOps project can view/list subscriptions that exist in a channel where they are not a member.

- Approve pipeline requests from your channel: 
  - A user can approve pipeline requests from within the channel by subscribing to "Release deployment approval pending" or "Run stage waiting for approval" (for YAML pipelines) event notifications.

  - While the running stage or a release deployment is awaiting approval, a notification is posted in the subscribed channel with the options to approve or reject the request. By reviewing the request's specifics in the notification, approvers can take the necessary action.
